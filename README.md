### Scenes

In Godot a game is a **tree of nodes** that you group together into
**scenes**. Essentially you break down your game into reusable scenes.
Scenes can be characters, weapons a menu, a level. Think of them kind 
of like a class. What a scene can be is very flexible.

#### Scene Nesting

You are able to nest scenes e.g you can put a character in a level
and drag and drop a scene as a child of it

### Nodes

Nodes are the game's smallest building blocks that make up a scene.
